API Written by (Discord: Piper0007) (Roblox: pludo903). Created to explain how to use the YAFN: Banana Edition open-source engine created on Roblox.

# Prerequisites
When first launching the engine on Roblox Studio, you need to go into “Game Settings” and enable API services as well as force the character to be R6. Also the saving system will not work until the game is published, so you can publish it as a private game or however you like. Lastly, I highly recommend that you open the view tab and open the Output Log (it displays important info that lets you know if something is broken or not).

Because Roblox is just amazing, most of or even all the sounds in the game may not load. This is because Roblox pushed out an update that revised the way that you can upload audio to solve the copyright issue. So, for each game you make you must upload new audio files for that game specifically. For now though, you will have to just upload your own audio files. [How to Upload Audio Files](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203314070-Audio-Files).

If you have used the YAFN engine before and are familiar with how to use it, the main things that you need to read about are events, animations, SongIDs, note splashes, modcharts, and icons. As all of those things are different, improved, or are entirely new features. Basically, I can just say that a lot of stuff is new, but I have made sure that old YAFN created items can be used with the engine, which is why the engine is an extension of YAFN engine and not something new entirely on its own.
