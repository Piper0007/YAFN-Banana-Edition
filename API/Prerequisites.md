# Prerequisites
When first launching the engine on Roblox Studio, you need to go into “Game Settings” and enable API services as well as force the character to be R6. Also the saving system will not work until the game is published, so you can publish it as a private game or however you like. Lastly, I highly recommend that you open the view tab and open the Output Log (it displays important info that lets you know if something is broken or not).

Because Roblox is just amazing, most of or even all the sounds in the game may not load. This is because Roblox pushed out an update that revised the way that you can upload audio to solve the copyright issue. So, for each game you make you must upload new audio files for that game specifically. For now though, you will have to just upload your own audio files.
